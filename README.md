# VolumeControl
C# thing that translates hotkeys to media key messages

I just got some new headphones and I ain't got no volume control on them. Since my keyboard has no media keys, I came up with this utility.

It just translate hotkey windows messages into keyboard windows messages emulating media keys.

I'll probably add some other features. As of now I just handle volume up/down. And they are hardcoded. Ugh. I feel like I am at work.
